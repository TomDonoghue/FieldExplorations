This repository is for explorations of ideas related to Periodic & Aperiodic neural activity.

Note that some things that used to be in this repo have been fixed up and added to the
[FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) docsite, under the
[motivations section](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_motivations/index.html).
