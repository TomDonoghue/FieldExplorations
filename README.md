# Field Explorations

This repository is for explorations of neural field data, in particular related to periodic & aperiodic neural activity.

Notebooks are simulation based, and explore ideas about neural field data, and the methods we commonly use to investigate it.

In addition to the scipy stack (scipy, numpy, matplotlib, etc), these notebooks require:
Requirements:
- [neurodsp](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp)
- [fooof](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof)

Note that some examples from this repo have been fixed up and moved to other places, for example being added to the 
[spectral parameterization](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) docsite, under the
[motivations section](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/auto_motivations/index.html).
